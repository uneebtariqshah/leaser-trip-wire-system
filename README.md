# Laser Trip Wire System 

A **laser trip wire** is a security or detection system that uses a laser beam to create an invisible barrier. When an object or person crosses the beam, it interrupts the laser, triggering an alarm, camera, or another response mechanism.  

## Components  

1. **Laser Source** – Emits a continuous beam of light, typically a red or infrared laser.  
2. **Receiver or Sensor** – Detects the laser beam and signals when it is interrupted. This can be a photoresistor, photodiode, or LDR (light-dependent resistor).  
3. **Control Circuit** – Processes signals from the receiver and activates an output (buzzer, alarm, or notification system).  
4. **Power Supply** – Provides the necessary power to the laser and control circuit.  

## How It Works  

1. The laser is pointed at the receiver, keeping the circuit in its normal state.  
2. When an object crosses the beam, the receiver no longer detects the laser.  
3. The circuit registers this change and activates the response (alarm, buzzer, or light).  

## Applications  

- **Security Systems** – Detects intruders in homes, offices, or restricted areas.  
- **Industrial Safety** – Used in hazardous areas to prevent accidental entry.  
- **Gaming & Interactive Systems** – Used in laser mazes or escape room challenges.  
- **Automatic Counters** – Counts objects or people passing through a specific area.
